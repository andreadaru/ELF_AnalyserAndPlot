# two basins separator! this part of ELF_AnalyseAndPlot is useful to separate 2 basin associate of a single atom
# the names of the 2-basins files are writed in ripall.com choosing each line to find the file
# the elaboration is performed. Then the value are transformed in array and searching if the first value
# of each line (IRC step) is single or repeated. New files are created for every variation from single to double 
# or vice versa.
